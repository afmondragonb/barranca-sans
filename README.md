Project for Introduction to Modern Type 2018 @ Letterform Archive SF

This typeface was created by Antonio Mondrag√≥n Becker while taking the Introduction to Modern type course at San Francisco's Letterform Archive under the instruction of Graham Bradley. The course goal was to learn the basics of type design as well as get a basic understanding of how RoboFont works. The ideal course outcome was a complete basic latin character set, numerals and basic punctuation.

The original file does not have a complete character set nor does it have kerning started. I will try to upload any relevant scans, notes, and files as the project progresses.

The goal of this project as of 2019 is to create a display typeface based on Barranca Sans with an extended latin character set for language support and multiple weights.
